#    speed on the Verrazano Bridge every five minutes. However if we don't get good
#    data from the feed or it appears to be stale, we don't send the delta.

#    Update: See polling_examples/traffic_deltas.py for an easier way to accomplish this
#    The warm/cold logic has been incorporated in to ChangePoll class
