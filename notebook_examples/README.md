If using Colab, we suggest starting the session by removing numpy 

    !pip uninstall numpy
    !pip install microprediction 
    
There aren't too many notebook examples here because to compete successfully you need a running process indefinitely, or a regularly scheduled script to run. There are tutorials starting at [Python module 1](https://www.microprediction.com/python-1).
