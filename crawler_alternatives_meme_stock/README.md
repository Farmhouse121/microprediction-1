## Meme Stock Prediction

The script Cystose Eel is an example of predicting the Meme stock of the hour. See the article [Predicting the Next Meme Stock with a Markov Chain](https://medium.com/adventures-in-data-science/predicting-the-next-meme-stock-with-a-markov-chain-b31a57521d62) for background
on the motivation for this stream. 

You can easily modify [cystose_eel.py](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/crawler_alternatives_meme_stock/cystose_eel.py) to inject your own ideas, then run the script.
